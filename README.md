For this assignment you will make a fork of the game codebase and rename the project as follows: the name of your fork should be the same as your project 2 but with the suffix CS_596_S22_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_OldGameName_Proj_04.

Here are a list of requirements for the project:

Your mobile games should be playable on your personal phone
Your mobile game should use touch input to adjust the power, angle, and firing of the cannon balls or game specific action.
Extra credit for using your phones accelerometer to move the position of the cannon ( instead of the arrow keys as in the original game).
